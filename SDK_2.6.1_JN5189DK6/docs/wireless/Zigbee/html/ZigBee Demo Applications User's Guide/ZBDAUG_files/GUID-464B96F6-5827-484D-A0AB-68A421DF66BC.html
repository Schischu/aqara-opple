<div class="body">
<p class="p">‘Finding and Binding’ is the process whereby ZigBee controlling devices find ZigBee
                  controlled devices by matching operational clusters and create entries in the
                  Binding table. The Coordinator supports Finding and Binding as an ‘Initiator’ that
                  tries to find targets to bind to. For demonstration, the Coordinator supports the
                  On/Off Cluster as a client, so the Finding and Binding process looks for devices
                  that support the On/Off cluster as a server in order to create bindings.</p>

<div class="p">To start Finding and Binding as an Initiator, first trigger Finding and Binding on a
                  second ‘Target’ device (such as the Router in this ZigBee example) by pressing the
                  User Interface button on the 'Target' device. <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The target device
                        must have first joined the ZigBee network. </div>
</div>

<p class="p">Next, enter “find” on the serial interface (of the Coordinator).</p>

            <p class="p">When Finding and Binding for a target has completed and a binding has
                  been created, the Coordinator sends an Identify Off command to the target device,
                  in order to signal completion of the process for the Target. Depending on the type
                  of bindings being created (either unicast or groupcast), an Add Group command may
                  be sent to the target device.</p>

<p class="p">Reporting is a mandatory feature in ZigBee 3.x. A device wishing to receive periodic
      and on-change reports from an operational server should create a remote binding for itself on
      the target device. This Coordinator sends a Binding Request to a target with an On/Off cluster
      server. It then receives periodic and on-change reports from that device, reporting the state
      of the OnOff attribute (0x0000) of the On/Off cluster. The frequency of the reports depends on
      the default report configuration of the individual target device. The device receiving the
      reports can request the change by sending a Report Configuration command.</p>
