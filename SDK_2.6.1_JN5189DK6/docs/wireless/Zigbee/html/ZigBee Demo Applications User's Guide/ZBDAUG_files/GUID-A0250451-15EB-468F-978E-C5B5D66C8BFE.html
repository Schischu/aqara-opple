<p class="p">There are four main elements of the OTA header that are used to identify the image,
      so that the OTA client is able to decide whether it should download the image. These are
      Manufacturer Code, Image Type, File Version, and OTA Header String:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li" id="GUID-A0250451-15EB-468F-978E-C5B5D66C8BFE__ITEM_7F4C1C55-FFD8-4499-96BF-B78DE08E4BE5">
        <strong class="ph b">Manufacturer Code:</strong> This is a 16-bit number that is a ZigBee-assigned identifier for
        each member company. In this application, this number has been set to 0x1037, which is the
        identifier for NXP. In the final product, this should be changed to the identifier of the
        manufacturer. The OTA client compares the Manufacturer Code in the advertised image with its
        own and the image downloads only if they match. </li>

<li class="li" id="GUID-A0250451-15EB-468F-978E-C5B5D66C8BFE__ITEM_5BBCF9DF-E794-48F9-93B4-23E9D7B72EB5">
        <strong class="ph b">Image Type:</strong> This is a manufacturer-specific 16-bit number in the range 0x0000 to
        0xFFBF. Its use is for the manufacturer to distinguish between devices. In this application,
        the Image Type is normally set to the ZigBee Device Type however this application uses
        0x0001 for the Router device and 0x0002 for the End Device (0x8001 and 0x8002 are used for
        encrypted images). The OTA client compares the advertised Image Type with its own and only
        downloads the image if they match. The product designer is entirely free to implement an
        identification scheme of their own. </li>

<li class="li" id="GUID-A0250451-15EB-468F-978E-C5B5D66C8BFE__ITEM_B11F6D6D-4828-4909-B024-2AA213EA5167">
        <strong class="ph b">File Version:</strong> This is a 32-bit number representing the version of the image. The OTA
        client compares the advertised version with its current version before deciding whether to
        download the image. </li>

<li class="li" id="GUID-A0250451-15EB-468F-978E-C5B5D66C8BFE__ITEM_2F08581B-453C-4BD1-8A60-8132603CFF69">
        <strong class="ph b">OTA Header String:</strong> This is a 32 byte character string and its use is manufacturer-
        specific. In this application, the OTA client compares the string in the advertised image
        with its own string before accepting an image for download. If the strings matches, then the
        image is accepted. In this way, the string can be used to provide extra detail for
        identifying images, such as hardware subtypes. </li>
