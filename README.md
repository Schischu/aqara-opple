# Aqara opple - Alternative Firmware

This page describes how to build and update your Aqara Opple Switch with a full Zigbee 3.0 compatible firmware.

## Description
By default the Aqara Opple Light switch runs a very limited Zigbee 3.0 stack. 
It is not visible in most common Zigbee Bridges, like Philips Hue.
While it can be paired with a Zigbee Network, functionality is very limited.

Per default only following functionality exsists:
- Key 0: All lights off
- Key 1: All lights on
- Key 2: All lights decrement brightness
- Key 3: All lights increment brightness
- Key 4: No function
- Key 5: No function

Thankfull Aqara decided to not lock the Aqara Opple NXP JN5189 Zigbee chip, and thereby allows the flashing of an alternative firmware.
