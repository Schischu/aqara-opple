<div class="body">
<p class="p">The Router and End Device supports the On/Off cluster as a server and implements the Finding and Binding process as a Target. To trigger Finding and Binding as a target, do the following:</p>

<ol class="ol"><li class="li">Press the USER INTERFACE button on the Carrier Boards of all the target devices (the same button
        is used to start Network Steering, described in <a class="xref" href="GUID-CA1FE15C-2D6D-4CD7-928E-F9F7C687C716.html#GUID-CA1FE15C-2D6D-4CD7-928E-F9F7C687C716__ID_9786A4FC-053E-44F5-A18F-224C0C9C9A34">Allowing Other Devices to Join the Network</a>).</li>

<li class="li">Start Finding and Binding on the Initiator device.</li>
</ol>

<p class="p">This causes the End Device or router to self-identify for 180 seconds, while the
      Initiator tries to find the identifying devices, query their capabilities and create bindings
      on those with matching operational clusters. As part of this process, the Route or End Device
      may receive an Add Group Command and/or a Binding Request Command.</p>

<p class="p">Reporting is a mandatory feature in ZigBee 3.x. The Router and End Device supports
      the On/Off cluster as a server and the OnOff attribute of this cluster is a reportable
      attribute as defined in the ZigBee Base Device Behavior Specification. The Router and End
      Device holds a default configuration for reporting the state of the OnOff attribute. Once a
      device wishing to receive these periodic and on-change reports has created a remote binding,
      the Router starts to send reports to this bound device. The frequency of the reports depends
      on the default report configuration of the individual target device, 60 seconds in this case.
      The device receiving the reports can request the change by sending a Report Configuration
      command.</p>
