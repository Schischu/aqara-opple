Overview
========

The lpc_adc_dma example shows how to use LPC ADC driver with DMA.

In this example, the sensor is used to created the input analog signal. 
When user type in any key from the keyboard, the software trigger API is called to start the conversion. 
When the ADC conversion is completed, it would trigger the DMA to move the ADC conversion result from ADC conversion data 
register to user indicated memory. Then the main loop waits for the transfer to be done and print the result to terminal.

Project Information
1.what are ADC conversion sequences?
  A conversion sequence is a single pass through a series of A/D conversions performed on a selected set of
  A/D channels. Software can set-up two independent conversion sequences, either of which can be triggered 
  by software or by a transition on one of the hardware triggers. Each sequence can be triggered by a different 
  hardware trigger. One of these conversion sequences is referred to as the A sequence and the other as the B
  sequence. It is not necessary to employ both sequences. An optional single-step mode allows advancing through
  the channels of a sequence one at a time on each successive occurrence of a trigger. The user can select whether
  a trigger on the B sequence can interrupt an already-in-progress A sequence. The B sequence, however, can never be
  interrupted by an A trigger.
  
2. How to use software-triggered conversion?
   There are two ways that software can trigger a conversion sequence:
      1. Start Bit: The first way to software-trigger an sequence is by setting the START bit in
         the corresponding SEQn_CTRL register. The response to this is identical to
         occurrence of a hardware trigger on that sequence. Specifically, one cycle of
         conversions through that conversion sequence will be immediately triggered except
         as indicated above. (In this example, we use this way.)
      2. Burst Mode: The other way to initiate conversions is to set the BURST bit in the
         SEQn_CTRL register. As long as this bit is 1 the designated conversion sequence will
         be continuously and repetitively cycled through. Any new software or hardware trigger
         on this sequence will be ignored. 
         
3. How to use DMA to work with ADC?
   The sequence-A or sequence-B conversion/sequence-complete interrupts may also be
   used to generate a DMA trigger. To trigger a DMA transfer, the same conditions must be
   met as the conditions for generating an interrupt.
   Remark: If the DMA is used, the ADC interrupt must be disabled in the NVIC.
   
Program Flow
1.This example demonstrates how to configure the A sequences with interrupt, assigning one channel with software
  trigger, you can configure channel via "DEMO_ADC_SAMPLE_CHANNEL_NUMBER".
  
2.Before configuration of the ADC begins, the ADC is put through a self-calibration cycle.  

3.Configure the DMA and DMAMUX to work with ADC sequences.

4.Enable the Conversion-Complete or Sequence-Complete DMA for sequences A.
  
5.After ADC channels are assigned to each of the sequences, if the user enters any key via terminal, software trigger will start.  
  
6.When the conversion completes, the DMA would be requested.

7.When the DMA transfer completes, DMA will trigger a interrupt. ISR would set the "bDmaTransferDone" to 'true'. Then main function will 
  print conversion result to terminal.
